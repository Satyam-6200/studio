# **App Name**: UI Spark

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered UI Generation: Generate UI layout code (HTML/CSS) based on user prompts. The tool should interpret the prompts and create UI code accordingly. Includes responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- UX Optimization Suggestions: Provide real-time UX suggestions, like suggesting better color contrast ratios or improvements to the UI flow.  Uses an AI model trained to critique existing UI and UX design.
- Component Library: Provide a searchable and filterable list of reusable UI components (buttons, forms, navigation bars, etc.) that can be added to a project.
- Real-time Preview: Render a real-time preview of the UI as the user modifies the prompt or adjusts components.
- Code Export: Enable users to export the generated UI code in a format ready to use in Next.js projects.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3F51B5), evoking reliability, depth, and precision, reflecting the AI's capabilities.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F2FA), creating a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) for highlighting interactive elements, calling attention to AI-generated options and features.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons for a modern and technical feel.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout to provide a structured design.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to provide a smooth user experience.
